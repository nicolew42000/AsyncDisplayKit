/** 
 * The ASLayoutable protocol declares a method for measuring the layout of an object. A layout
 * is defined by an ASLayout return value, and must specify 1) the size (but not position) of the
 * layoutable object, and 2) the size and position of all of its immediate child objects. The tree 
 * recursion is driven by parents requesting layouts from their children in order to determine their 
 * size, followed by the parents setting the position of the children once the size is known
 *
 * The protocol also implements a "family" of Layoutable protocols. These protocols contain layout 
 * options that can be used for specific layout specs. For example, ASStackLayoutSpec has options
 * defining how a layoutable should shrink or grow based upon available space.
 *
 * These layout options are all stored in an ASLayoutOptions class (that is defined in ASLayoutablePrivate).
 * Generally you needn't worry about the layout options class, as the layoutable protocols allow all direct
 * access to the options via convenience properties. If you are creating custom layout spec, then you can
 * extend the backing layout options class to accommodate any new layout options.

 * Override this method to compute your nodes's layout.

 * @discussion Why do you need to override -calculateLayoutThatFits: instead of -calculateLayoutThatFits:parentSize:?
 * The base implementation of -calculateLayoutThatFits:parentSize: does the following for you:
 * 1. First, it uses the parentSize parameter to resolve the nodes's size (the one assigned to the sizeRange property).
 * 2. Then, it intersects the resolved size with the constrainedSize parameter. If the two don't intersect,
 *    constrainedSize wins. This allows a component to always override its childrens' sizes when computing its layout.
 *    (The analogy for UIView: you might return a certain size from -sizeThatFits:, but a parent view can always override
 *    that size and set your frame to any size.)
 *
 * @param constrainedSize A min and max size. This is computed as described in the description. The ASLayout you
 *                        return MUST have a size between these two sizes.
